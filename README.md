# COSC2803 2402 Week 07 Workshop Starter Code
Starter code for Week 07 Workshop for Javalin and Thymeleaf.

# Building & Running the code
1. Open this project within VSCode
2. Allow VSCode to read the pom.xml file
 - Allow the popups to run and "say yes" to VSCode configuring the build
 - Allow VSCode to download the required Java libraries
3. To Build & Run
 - Select the "Launch App" launcher profile from the VSCode Run/Debugger
 - Alternatively, open the src/main/java/app/App.java source file, and select "Run" from the pop-up above the main function
4. Go to: http://localhost:7001

# Important Notes
1. ONLY modify the files which you are allowed to edit. The other files are placed in important places to make our "big software project" work.
1. DO NOT move the Java files from the ```src/main/java/app``` folder. These Java files need to be in this location to ensure our "big software project" works.
1. These exercises contain examples for *both* pre-req and co-req students. There is no separation of code in these exercises, as all students are able to complete them.

# DEV Container for GitHub Codespaces
The ```.devcontainer``` folder contains configuration files for GitHub Codespaces.
This ensures that when the GitHub classroom is cloned, the workspace is correctly configured for Java (V16) and with the required VSCode extensions.
This folder will not affect a *local* VSCode setup on a computer.
